InfoGrappo is a crowdsourcing platform that merges the wisdom of the community. The most interesting point of project is imaginary or realistic relations between topics that could be a word or a couple of words. Both the relations and topics are driven by the users of our community. They create topics, share their ideas about topics or share cognition of relations between topics.
